# hello-world
First Git-Hub repository. I hope to look back on this in four years, having built much much more complex programs 
My name is Thomas Rigal, I am a begginning freshmen in CS at Boston University. CS is incredibly interesting to me, even though my knowledge is minimal. I hope to vastly expand my knowledge of the subject thoroughout my four years, and my life. I will attempt to put many (if not all of my projects on GitHub.)
P.S. Thomas in the future, if you're reading this, I hope you're an exceptional coder, and are working hard! Good luck, bud!
